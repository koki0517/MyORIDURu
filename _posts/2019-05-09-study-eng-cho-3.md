## 35강. All you have to do is ~
- All you have to do is follow my lead.
>All you have to do is click.<br>
>All you have to do is practice.<br>
>All you have to do is wait and see. 굿이나 보고 떡이나 먹어~<br>

- All I want is to find a nice guy.
>All I want for Christmas is you.<br>
>All I want is a fat bank account.<br>
>All I want is to be with you.<br>

- What I mean is I don’t love her.
>What I mean is I’m through. 내 말은 됐다는 얘기야.<br>
>What I mean is I’m not a bad person.<br>
>What I mean is he’s as tough as nails. 내 말은 그 사람이 강인한 사람이라는 얘기야.<br>

- What I’m trying to say is I love you.
>What I’m trying to say is you bug me. 내가 말하려고 하는건…네가 날 귀찮게~(주저하는 말투)<br>
>What I’m trying to say is it’s my fault.<br>

## 36강. It could be ~
- It could be worse. 더 나빳을 수도 있어.(그만하길 다행이야.)
>It could be a while. 시간이 더 걸릴 수도 있어요.<br>
>It couldn't be better. 이보다 더 좋을 순 없어요.<br>

- It would be hard to believe. 믿기 힘들 거예요.(could 보다 주관적인 느낌)
>It would be hard to understand.<br>
>It would be nice to stay a little longer.<br>

- It wouldn't hurt you to be careful. 조심해서 나쁠건 없어.
>It wouldn't hurt you to try.<br>
>It wouldn't kill you to be nice to her.<br>

- It can't be true. 그게 사실일 리가 없어.
>It can't be possible.<br>
>This can't be happening.<br>
